# Test Plan for Card Functionality

This plan outlines the tests I would implement using **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to ensure the functionality and user experience of the card component.

## 1. Expand/Collapse Functionality
- **Testing expand behavior:**
  - Verify that clicking the "Expand" button updates the `isExpanded` state.
  - Ensure the card description appears when expanded and disappears when collapsed.
- **Animations:**
  - Confirm that expand/collapse animations work smoothly.

## 2. Delete Button
- **Testing delete functionality:**
  - Verify that clicking the "Delete" button sets `isDeleted` to `true`.
  - Ensure the card becomes invisible (or hidden if revealed).

## 3. Deleted Cards Counter
- **Displaying the counter:**
  - Verify that the counter updates correctly after a card is deleted.
- **Data consistency:**
  - Confirm that the counter remains accurate after refreshing the page.

## 4. "Reveal" Button
- **Revealing deleted cards:**
  - Ensure that clicking the "Reveal" button displays deleted cards.
  - Verify that revealed cards do not show their descriptions.

## 5. "Refresh" Button
- **Refreshing state:**
  - Verify that clicking "Refresh" reloads the state of cards from local storage.
  - Ensure the restored state matches the last saved state (expanded/deleted status).

## 6. Local State (Zustand + localStorage)
- **State persistence:**
  - Ensure that card states (expanded/deleted) persist after a page refresh.
  - Verify that data is correctly saved to and read from `localStorage`.

## 7. ToggleButton Component
- **Functionality testing:**
  - Confirm that the `ToggleButton` works correctly for all use cases (e.g., expand/collapse functionality).

## 8. User Interactions
- **General flow testing:**
  - Verify that combinations of actions (expand, delete, reveal, refresh) do not cause errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Edge cases:**
  - Test what happens when the user tries to reveal cards when none have been deleted.

## 9. UX/UI
- **Visual tests:**
  - Ensure that animations and state changes are intuitive for users.
- **Responsive behavior:**
  - Verify that the cards render and function properly on different screen sizes.
